        <h2>Serverless?</h2>
        <p>Tired of the risks imposed by trusted third parties, we've decided to design a new software architecture that is <strong>easier to use</strong>, <strong>safer to run</strong>, and <strong>more resilient to attack</strong>.</p>
        <p>To accomplish our goals, we're removing servers from the equation and going <strong>entirely peer-to-peer</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Encrypted by Default</h3>
        <p>Fabric uses high-power encryption to secure communications across the network, ensuring that <em>user privacy is preserved by default</em>.</p>

        <h3>People over Profit</h3>
        <p>Rather than enforcing arbitrary decisions "for the good of the community", Fabric is an open-source, offline-first protocol that gives users the ultimate power of their own experiences.  Applications published in the Fabric network are shared as "source code", with their behaviors and functionality clearly described in human-readible form.</p>
